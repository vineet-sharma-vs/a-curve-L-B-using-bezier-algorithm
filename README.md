1.Work in 2D.  Write a function to draw a curve(L,B) using bezier algorithm. 4 control points will be (0,0), (B+B/2,L/4), (B+B/2,3*L/4), (0,L). This would look like half petal of a flower.

2. Use transformation to create a full petal.

3. use transformation to create a flower with six petals.

4. Use transformation to create a set of 10 random sized, random located flowers.
